# About
The Mini-C compiler is a language and compiler designed for courses on compiler development. The language itself contains many similarities to the C language but some parts are more restrictive or different than those in C. 

Since Mini-C is designed to have a compiler implemented by students within a single semester, it contains very few features. It doesn't have user defined structures, pointers, references, or other types that exist in modern programming languages. Additionally, memory is manually managed. Every time you create an array with the **new** keyword memory is allocated which later needs to be freed with the **free** keyword. 

You may learn more about the language by reading the documentation under the Language category.
